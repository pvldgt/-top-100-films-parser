# Create a Spotify playlist from top 100 hits of any past date 

This is an educational project that I completed within Day 46 of this course https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code

The script asks a user for a past date. Then the script parses the Billboard Hot 100 website to find the 100 tracks that were hot on that date.

Then, using the Spotipy library, the script creates a Spotify playlist and adds the hot 100 tracks to it. 

As a result, the user will have an automatically created playlist in their Spotify account. 
It will feature the songs that were in the Billboard Hot 100 Chart on the day that you specified.
